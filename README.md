OpenSOAR is the orchestration and automation layer for the modern SOC. It sits between your SIEM (Elastic, Splunk) and your response tools, letting you write automation logic in plain Python — no sandboxes, no per-action billing, no vendor lock-in.

Built for IR analysts and MSSPs. Dark-themed, fast, opinionated.

**Get running in 30 seconds:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensoar-hq/opensoar-core.git && cd opensoar-core && docker compose up -d
```

Bootstrap the first local admin:

```bash
docker compose exec api opensoar-bootstrap-admin \
  --username admin \
  --password changeme \
  --display-name "OpenSOAR Admin"
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in. Additional local accounts are created by an admin from Settings.

When pulling updates on an existing Docker Compose deployment, use:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

That ensures the migration image and the application images are refreshed together during upgrades.

## Why OpenSOAR?

### vs. Open-Source Alternatives

| | **OpenSOAR** | Shuffle | Tracecat | StackStorm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub stars | New | ~2,200 | ~3,500 | ~6,000 |
| License | Apache 2.0 | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0 | Apache 2.0 |
| Automation | Python (async) | Visual/JSON workflows | YAML workflows | YAML + Python |
| Built-in AI | Yes (free) | No | Yes | No |
| Integrations | 5 built-in | 1,000+ (app library) | Growing | 160+ packs |
| Playbook style | Code-first | Drag-and-drop | YAML definitions | YAML rules + Python |
| Backed by | Community | Community | YC W24 | Linux Foundation (minimal activity) |

**Honest take:** Shuffle and StackStorm have far more integrations today. But their approaches — drag-and-drop JSON or YAML rule files — hit a ceiling fast when you need conditional logic, parallel enrichment, or custom response flows. OpenSOAR gives you native Python with `async`/`await`, which means anything you can write in Python, you can automate. No DSL translation layer, no sandbox limitations.

Tracecat is the closest competitor in philosophy (YC-backed, developer-focused) but uses YAML workflows and AGPL licensing, which restricts how you can embed and redistribute it.

**Also worth knowing:**
- **TheHive** — formerly the go-to open-source SOAR, now archived. StrangeBee pivoted to commercial-only licensing. If you're migrating off TheHive, OpenSOAR is a natural landing spot.
- **DFIR-IRIS** — excellent open-source incident response platform (LGPL), but focused on case management and forensics, not orchestration/automation. Complementary to OpenSOAR, not a replacement.

### vs. Commercial Platforms

| | **OpenSOAR** | Tines | Palo Alto XSOAR |
|---|---|---|---|
| License | Apache 2.0 | Proprietary | Proprietary |
| Per-action billing | No | Yes | Yes |
| Self-hosted | Yes | No | On-prem option |
| Built-in AI | Yes (free) | Paid add-on | Paid add-on |
| Playbook style | Code-first | Drag-and-drop | Mixed (YAML + Python) |
| Best for | Python-literate SOC teams | No-code teams | Enterprises with Palo Alto stack |
